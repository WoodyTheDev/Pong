# Pong

## About The Project

The project is the result of the course patterns and frameworks in the university emden/leer. It was a group project and I handled the server.

It is the game pong with server and clients, so that 2 players can play against each other.

## Built With

This project has a server and 2 clients.

-	Java Spring Boot
-	Angular
-	JavaFX

### Server

Java Spring Boot 3.0
JDK 17

-	Swagger
-	Authorization (JWT Token)
-	Database connection
-	User/Player handling
-	Image upload
-	Player history

-	Multiple game handling

## Project status
It is not polished and would take a lot of time to make it presentable. Also I would need linux cloud machine that i dont have. Maybe in the future i will migrate the portfolio site to a linux cloud machine and add the game pong to it. But for now, enjoy the code!
